## Cron Helper For WooCommerce Bookings

### Description

WooCommerce Bookings uses WP Cron to remove In Cart bookings and also to complete Paid and Confirmed bookings. The issue with this is that WP Cron is not always reliable. It works 99.9% of the time, but not 100%. 

This plugin adds on to that by double checking to make sure In Cart bookings are removed and past bookings are set to completed. 


### Installation

1. Download the .zip file.
1. Go to Plugins > Add New and choose Upload at the top.
1. Upload the .zip file and activate. 


### Usage

There is nothing you need to do after this. It adds a scheduled event to run every 5 minutes to do its work.
